    "section": "",
    "text": "After maintaining my academic website using Hugo with the Toha theme, I recently made the decision to migrate to Quarto. This post documents my journey, the reasons behind the switch, and lessons learned during the migration process.\n\n\nMy original website was built using:\n\nHugo: Fast static site generator\nToha Theme: Beautiful academic portfolio theme\nYAML data files: Structured content management\nGitHub Pages: Free hosting and deployment\n\nThe Hugo setup served me well for several years, providing a professional-looking academic portfolio with sections for about, experience, projects, and blog posts.\n\n\n\nSeveral factors influenced my decision to migrate:\n\n\nAs a researcher working primarily with R, Quarto offers seamless integration:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Example: Embedding live data analysis in website content\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  technology = c(\"Hugo\", \"Quarto\", \"Traditional CMS\"),\n  research_integration = c(2, 10, 1),\n  ease_of_use = c(6, 9, 8)\n)\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = research_integration, y = ease_of_use, \n                 color = technology, size = 3)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Technology Comparison for Academic Websites\",\n    x = \"Research Integration (1-10)\",\n    y = \"Ease of Use (1-10)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  guides(size = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Quarto, I can now:\n\nWrite blog posts with embedded R code and live results\nCreate presentations from the same content\nGenerate PDFs for academic papers\nMaintain consistent styling across all outputs\n\n\n\n\nQuarto provides:\n\nBetter developer tools and VS Code integration\nLive preview during development\nMore flexible theming options\nBuilt-in Bootstrap integration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest challenge was converting Hugo‚Äôs YAML-based content structure to Quarto‚Äôs markdown files:\n# Hugo structure (data/en/sections/about.yaml)\nsection:\n  name: About\n  designation: \"Postdoc Researcher\"\n  company:\n    name: \"University of Missouri\"\n  summary: 'Research summary...'\n  socialLinks:\n    - name: Github\n      icon: \"fab fa-github\"\n      url: \"https://github.com/username\"\nTo Quarto‚Äôs integrated markdown:\n---\ntitle: \"About\"\n---\n\n## Background\nResearch summary integrated directly in markdown...\n\n[{{&lt; fa brands github &gt;}} GitHub](https://github.com/username)\n\n\n\nMoving images and static files required:\n\nReorganizing directory structure\nUpdating image references\nConverting icon systems (Font Awesome integration)\nAdapting responsive layouts\n\n\n\n\nTransitioning from Toha‚Äôs custom CSS to Bootstrap-based styling:\n\nMaintained visual consistency\nAdapted color schemes and typography\nEnsured mobile responsiveness\nAdded custom SCSS for specific needs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create new Quarto project\nmkdir alckmin-quarto-site\ncd alckmin-quarto-site\nquarto create-project . --type website\n\n\n\nI created a systematic approach:\n\nExtracted content from YAML files\nConverted to Quarto markdown format\nReorganized directory structure\nUpdated internal links and references\n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrap theme selection and customization\nSCSS variables for consistent branding\nComponent styling for cards, timelines, etc.\nResponsive design optimization\n\n\n\n\n# GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment\nname: Render and Publish\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/render@v2\n      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2\n        with:\n          path: docs\n      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I can:\n\nInclude live R analysis in blog posts\nEmbed interactive visualizations\nMaintain reproducible content\nVersion control everything in one place\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-source publishing: Same content for web, PDF, presentations\nLive code execution: Results update automatically\nBetter collaboration: Markdown-based content is easier to edit\nVersion control: Git-friendly plain text format\n\n\n\n\nThe new site includes:\n\nInteractive code blocks with copy functionality\nMathematical expressions with KaTeX\nResponsive design that works on all devices\nFast loading with optimized assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent audit before migration saved time\nAsset inventory helped track all files\nURL mapping maintained SEO value\nBackup strategy provided peace of mind\n\n\n\n\nInstead of a big-bang approach:\n\nSet up parallel development\nMigrate content section by section\nTest thoroughly at each stage\nMaintain old site until confident\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarto documentation is excellent\nCommunity examples provided inspiration\nGitHub discussions helped solve specific issues\nBootstrap themes offered design starting points\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Quarto foundation in place, I‚Äôm planning:\n\nEnhanced data visualizations with Observable JS\nInteractive tutorials using Quarto‚Äôs computational features\nAutomated content updates from research databases\nMulti-format publishing for presentations and papers\n\n\n\n\nFor other academics considering a similar migration:\n\n\nConsider Quarto if you:\n\nWork primarily with R, Python, or Julia\nWant integrated computational content\nValue reproducible research workflows\nNeed multiple output formats\n\n\n\n\n\nStart small with a new section or blog\nUse migration tools where available\nTest thoroughly across devices and browsers\nDocument your process for future reference\nBackup everything before starting\n\n\n\n\n\nMigrating from Hugo to Quarto has significantly improved my research workflow and website management experience. While the migration required substantial effort, the benefits of having an integrated platform for research, analysis, and communication make it worthwhile.\nThe ability to embed live code, create reproducible content, and maintain everything in a unified workflow has already enhanced both my research productivity and my ability to share findings with the community.\nFor researchers seeking a modern, integrated approach to academic websites, Quarto represents a compelling choice that bridges the gap between research tools and web publishing.\n\nInterested in learning more about my migration process or Quarto for academic websites?
