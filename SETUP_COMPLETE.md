## 🌐 Next Steps to Go Live

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `alckmin-quarto-site`
3. Description: `Personal academic website built with Quarto - Remote Sensing & Agriculture Research`
4. Make it **Public** ✅
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code

```bash
cd /home/gtalckmin/alckmin-quarto-site

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/gtalckmin/alckmin-quarto-site.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository → **Settings** tab
2. Left sidebar → **Pages**
3. Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"** ✅
4. Save

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

The GitHub Action will automatically:
- Install Quarto and R
