# R Markdown for Reproducible Research

This is an R Markdown document demonstrating the power of literate programming. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

R Markdown has been instrumental in my research workflow, allowing me to combine code, analysis, and narrative in a single document. This is particularly valuable in agricultural research where reproducibility and transparency are crucial.

## Embedding R Code

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#| label: cars-summary
#| echo: true
#| message: false

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Examine the built-in cars dataset
summary(cars)

# Fit a linear model
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
summary(fit)
```

The relationship between speed and stopping distance is clearly non-linear, which is typical in many agricultural and physical processes I work with in my remote sensing research.

## Creating Visualizations

Let's create a more informative plot than the original:

```{r speed-distance-plot}
#| label: fig-speed-distance
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between speed and stopping distance"
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point(color = "#2c3e50", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#3498db", fill = "#3498db", alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Car Speed vs Stopping Distance",
    x = "Speed (mph)",
    y = "Stopping Distance (ft)",
    subtitle = "Linear relationship with considerable variation"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = "gray60"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

## Including Traditional Plots

You can also embed traditional R plots. Here's the classic pie chart example:

```{r pie}
#| label: fig-pie
#| fig-cap: "A fancy pie chart demonstrating traditional R graphics"
#| echo: true

par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, 
  border = NA
)
```

## Relevance to Agricultural Research

In my work with remote sensing and agricultural data, R Markdown serves several important purposes:

1. **Reproducible Analysis**: All analysis steps are documented and can be re-run
2. **Transparent Methods**: Code is visible alongside results and interpretation
3. **Efficient Report Generation**: Same document can produce multiple output formats
4. **Version Control**: Text-based format works well with Git for tracking changes

This approach has been invaluable in my PhD research and current postdoc work, where reproducibility and transparency are essential for scientific credibility.

## Modern Alternatives

While R Markdown has served the community well, I'm now transitioning to **Quarto** (which powers this website) as it offers:

- Better multi-language support (R, Python, Julia)
- More flexible output formats
- Enhanced web publishing capabilities
- Improved visual editor

The principles remain the same: combining code, analysis, and narrative for reproducible research.
