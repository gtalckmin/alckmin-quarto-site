Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nR Markdown has been instrumental in my research workflow, allowing me to combine code, analysis, and narrative in a single document. This is particularly valuable in agricultural research where reproducibility and transparency are crucial.\n\n## Embedding R Code\n\nYou can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/cars-summary_04673e39c1df6e24e135cef81978f4a8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Examine the built-in cars dataset\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit a linear model\nfit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)\nsummary(fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-29.069  -9.525  -2.272   9.215  43.201 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept) -17.5791     6.7584  -2.601   0.0123 *  \nspeed         3.9324     0.4155   9.464 1.49e-12 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 15.38 on 48 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.6511,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.6438 \nF-statistic: 89.57 on 1 and 48 DF,  p-value: 1.49e-12\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe relationship between speed and stopping distance is clearly non-linear, which is typical in many agricultural and physical processes I work with in my remote sensing research.\n\n## Creating Visualizations\n\nLet's create a more informative plot than the original:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/fig-speed-distance_2ba189e86a62026dd8a058061769f2da'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#2c3e50\", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"#3498db\", fill = \"#3498db\", alpha = 0.2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Car Speed vs Stopping Distance\",\n    x = \"Speed (mph)\",\n    y = \"Stopping Distance (ft)\",\n    subtitle = \"Linear relationship with considerable variation\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = \"gray60\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Relationship between speed and stopping distance](index_files/figure-html/fig-speed-distance-1.png){#fig-speed-distance width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Including Traditional Plots\n\nYou can also embed traditional R plots. Here's the classic pie chart example:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/fig-pie_d42b6fd8e86e7153d22ab6477b1c3caa'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))\npie(\n  c(280, 60, 20),\n  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),\n  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),\n  init.angle = -50, \n  border = NA\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A fancy pie chart demonstrating traditional R graphics](index_files/figure-html/fig-pie-1.png){#fig-pie width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Relevance to Agricultural Research\n\nIn my work with remote sensing and agricultural data, R Markdown serves several important purposes:\n\n1. **Reproducible Analysis**: All analysis steps are documented and can be re-run\n2. **Transparent Methods**: Code is visible alongside results and interpretation\n3. **Efficient Report Generation**: Same document can produce multiple output formats\n4. **Version Control**: Text-based format works well with Git for tracking changes\n\nThis approach has been invaluable in my PhD research and current postdoc work, where reproducibility and transparency are essential for scientific credibility.\n\n## Modern Alternatives\n\nWhile R Markdown has served the community well, I'm now transitioning to **Quarto** (which powers this website) as it offers:\n\n- Better multi-language support (R, Python, Julia)\n- More flexible output formats\n- Enhanced web publishing capabilities\n- Improved visual editor\n\nThe principles remain the same: combining code, analysis, and narrative for reproducible research.\n\n---\n\n*This post demonstrates the evolution of my documentation and analysis workflow from traditional R Markdown to modern Quarto publishing.*\n",
